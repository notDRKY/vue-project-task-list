# Project: vue-project-task-list

___

👋🏻 Hi! This was my first project developed in Vue3, it was a challenge to adapt to the reactive inputs, but I was able to develop a knowledge base to work on.

👨🏻‍🎓 I must not forget that this project was entirely developed at the end of the year 2022 in my second year of the higher degree course in web application development. 

You can see the demo of the project in this link: https://task-list-ten-snowy.vercel.app/
